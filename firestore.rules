/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the SnuggleShop application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around the principle that users have exclusive control
 * over their own data. All authorization is derived from the authenticated user's
 * UID, ensuring that a user can only ever access or modify their own documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is stored in a top-level `users` collection. Each user
 * is represented by a single document where the document ID is the user's
 * Firebase Authentication UID (e.g., /users/{userId}).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed
 *   to prevent enumeration of all application users.
 * - Strict Ownership: All read and write operations on a user's profile document
 *   are restricted to the owner of that document.
 * - Self-Creation: A user is permitted to create their own profile document, but
 *   not a profile for any other user ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on path-based security, where the document ID (`userId`)
 * directly corresponds to the owner's Firebase Auth UID. This is the most
 * performant and secure method for this data structure, as it avoids any need for
 * extra database reads (`get()` calls) to determine ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable in this model, as all data within the `/users` collection is
 * treated as private to its respective owner.
