It adheres to the principle of Authorization Independence by relying on path-based ownership for user profiles. The structure uses a dedicated collection `users` to store user profile data. This approach provides a clear and secure method for managing user data and access.  Since the application uses Firebase Authentication, the User ID from Authentication will be used as the document ID in the `/users/{userId}` collection, making path-based rules simple and efficient. This also eliminates the need for custom claims or complex role-based access control, ensuring security and separation of concerns."
